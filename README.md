# Chat with your manuals
Boring Manuals No More! How to Turn Your Camera Manual into a Helpful Chatbot

## Usage
Imagine never having to struggle through a confusing camera manual again. Now, you can have a conversation with it instead! Let's break down how this works:
Step 1: We will use PyPDF to load the PDFs, convert them to embeddings and save them in Chroma vector db.
Step 2: Create a RAG pipeline using LangChain Expression Language to let you ask questions directly from the manual.
Step 3: Chat Away! Now, you can ask things like "Give me some suggestions to photograph birds in flight" instead of digging through pages.
